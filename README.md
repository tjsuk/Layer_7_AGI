# The Seven Layers of AI, Layer 7: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)

[![License: Personal Use](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Personal%20Use-red.svg)](LICENSE)

This notebook accompanies **Chapter 8, Layer 7: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)** of the study guide *The Seven Layers of AI*. It contains every example program from the chapter in the order it appears, so you can run, change and experiment with the code as you read.

## What is in the notebook

For each program you will find:

1. **The explanation** from the guide that introduces the program.
2. **The code**, with a header explaining its purpose, how it works and what to look for, plus comments throughout.
3. **The output from a test run**, already saved in the notebook, so you can read it before running anything.
4. **The output shown in the guide**, for comparison. The two should match, apart from timings.
5. **What the output shows**, a short interpretation.
6. **Investigate** tasks, which suggest changes to make and questions to answer.

The programs are small experiments that collect evidence about the limits of today's narrow systems. The whole notebook runs in about two minutes.

## Programs

| # | File | Topic | Status |
|---|------|-------|--------|
| 1 | `l7_contamination.py` | benchmark contamination | runs in the notebook |
| 2 | `l7_arc_search.py` | solving ARC-style puzzles by program search | runs in the notebook |
| 3 | `l7_distribution_shift.py` | the limits of narrow generalisation | runs in the notebook |
| 4 | `l7_forgetting.py` | catastrophic forgetting | runs in the notebook |
| 5 | `l7_forecasting.py` | why forecasts disagree | runs in the notebook |
| 6 | `l7_specification_gaming.py` | specification gaming | runs in the notebook |

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or later
- Jupyter (JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, or VS Code with the Jupyter extension)
- Packages: `numpy scikit-learn`

The notebook takes about 2 minutes to run from top to bottom on a typical laptop.

## Setting up

These steps create a separate Python environment so the packages do not interfere with anything else on your computer. Run them in a terminal, from the folder that contains this README.

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install jupyterlab numpy scikit-learn
jupyter lab
```

**macOS or Linux**

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install jupyterlab numpy scikit-learn
jupyter lab
```

JupyterLab opens in your browser. Double-click `Layer7_AGI.ipynb` to open it.

**VS Code:** open this folder, open `Layer7_AGI.ipynb`, and choose the `.venv` environment when VS Code asks you to select a kernel. Install the packages into that environment first, as above.

**Google Colab:** upload `Layer7_AGI.ipynb` at https://colab.research.google.com. Most packages are already installed; if one is missing, remove the `#` from the `%pip install` line in the setup cell and run it.

## Using the notebook

1. **Run the setup cell first.** It is the first code cell. Uncomment the `%pip install` line if you have not installed the packages.
2. **Run cells from top to bottom** with Shift+Enter, or use *Run All*. Each program is self-contained, so after the setup cell you can also jump to any program and run just that one.
3. **Read the saved output before running.** It shows what to expect. When you run a cell, the saved output is replaced with yours.
4. **Compare with the guide.** The programs use fixed random seeds, so your numbers should match the guide exactly. Only timings, such as the seconds reported while training, vary between computers.
5. **Work through the Investigate tasks.** Edit the code directly in the cell and run it again. If you want to get back to the original, the code is also printed in the guide.
6. **Restart when things get confusing.** All programs share one Python session, so a variable changed in one cell can affect a later one. *Kernel > Restart Kernel and Clear Outputs* gives you a clean start.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | What to do |
|---------|------------|
| `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named ...` | The package is not installed in the environment the notebook is using. Run `%pip install <package>` in a cell, then restart the kernel. |
| A cell has been running for a long time | Training programs can take a minute or more. Watch the `[*]` marker beside the cell; use *Kernel > Interrupt* to stop it. |
| Numbers differ slightly from the guide | Check you have not changed a seed or parameter. Very different package versions can also change results slightly; the notebooks were tested with NumPy 2.4, scikit-learn 1.8 and pandas 3.0. |
| `FileNotFoundError` for a data file | Run the cell that creates the file first (for example, the `%%writefile` cell), and keep the notebook in the folder it runs from. |

## Using this with learners

- Ask learners to **predict the output** before running a program, then explain any differences.
- Most Investigate tasks can be completed in 10 to 20 minutes and work well as paired activities.
- Encourage learners to **break the code deliberately** (change a learning rate, remove a line) and explain what happens. It is often the fastest way to understand why each line is there.
